\title{
Mixtures of spherical Cauchy distributions
}

\description{
It performs model based clustering for circualr, spherical and hyperspherical data assuming spherical Cauchy distributions.
}

\usage{
mixspcauchy.mle(x, g, n.start = 10)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data expressed as unit vectors.
}
\item{g}{
The number of groups to fit. It must be greater than or equal to 2.
}
\item{n.start}{
The number of random starts to try. See also R's built-in function \code{\link{kmeans}} for more information about this.
}
}

\details{
The initial step of the algorithm is not based on a spherical k-means, but on simple k-means.
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{param}{
A matrix with the mean direction, the concetrations parameter and mixing probability of each group.
}
\item{loglik}{
The value of the maximised log-likelihood.
}
\item{pred}{
The predicted group of each observation.
}
\item{w}{
The estimated probabilities of each observation to belong to each cluster.
}
\item{iter}{
The number of iteration required by the EM algorithm.
}
\item{runtime}{
The run time of the algorithm. A numeric vector. The first element is the user time, the second element is the system time and the third element is the elapsed time.
